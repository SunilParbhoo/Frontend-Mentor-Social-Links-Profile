## My process

I recreated this Social Links Profile as closely as possible based off the jpg designs provided in the challenge. I approximated margin/padding height/width sizes by opening the jpg in Mac OSX preview window. This site was built to be responsive, and this challenge provided additional practice in recreating responsive designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS transform and transitions for animated states

### What I learned

I enjoyed recreating this challenge. I found it tricky to get things lined up just right per the design pictures (without the use of figma files this time), however I am happy with this attempt. I also tried utilizing transitions and transforms to customize and differentiate my code from the challenge, while sticking closely to the design.
